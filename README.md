# Fingerprint-Attendance-System-Using-Arduino
This project implements a secure, accurate Fingerprint-Based Biometric Attendance System using Arduino. It uses an R305 fingerprint sensor, DS3231 RTC, and a 16×2 LCD to record attendance with real-time timestamps. The system improves traditional attendance by eliminating manual errors and buddy punching. Components include Arduino UNO, RTC module, sensor, buttons, buzzer, LED, and power supply. This prototype demonstrates efficient biometric authentication and serves as a foundation for future enhancements like data storage and IoT integration.
